Welcome to our first full project with react so dont be too mean with it pls!
You can run the proyect with npm run start or check it in this netlify link: "https://thefoodandtrain.netlify.app/" 

Food and Train is a mobile App in which through the Harris-Benedict Calorie Calculator, you can develop a training plan and weekly menu in a personalized area through user registration. Both workouts and recipes have all the information you need to reach your goal.

The blocks that we have incorporated into the project are:
Project structure with React functional components and routes.
We also applied Redux creating communication between components, we have developed our "back" through Jsons, templates and reactive forms.
We will use Session Storage and send the user to a registration page where he will log in.
He will calculate the Kcal he needs to maintain, gain muscle or lose weight.
Based on that, he will be able to customize his user zone with workouts and a personalized diet.
We will also put into practice all the knowledge acquired in HTML, CSS, SCSS, BEM methodology and JS.
